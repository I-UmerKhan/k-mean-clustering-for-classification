# k-mean-clustering-for-classification
I learned how to use k-means clustering for classification. This method is useful because it partitions data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity, minimizing the variance within each cluster. K-means is particularly effective for large datasets and helps in discovering underlying patterns and groupings within the data. It provides a clear and concise way to categorize data points, which can be valuable for improving the accuracy of classification models, reducing dimensionality, and enhancing data visualization and interpretation.
